    <h3>Final Product</h3>
    <p>This coffee <em>WILL</em> turn you gay! You have been warned!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Your Favorite Coffee Blend (I like Medium Roast).</li>
        <li>Full-Fat Oatmilk</li>
        <li>Flavoring, such as Lavendar or <em>Homemade</em> Pumpkin Spice.</li>
        <li>Your Favorite Mug</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whatever coffee brewing method you prefer or have access to will be best, the most important part is to very intentional with your brewing. Otherwise it's not gay.</li>
        <li>Once your coffee is brewed, pour into you mug or glass of preference. Something clear works best because <em>seeing</em> your cute drink is half the fun.</li>
        <li>add your flavoring and whatever spices, such as cinnamon, you like and mix well. <em>Tip: It is important to add your falvorings and spices nwop when the coffee is hot. No, I will not elaborate.</em></li>
        <li>It would not be gay coffee without ice (just kidding, its gay coffee because <em>YOU'RE</em> drinking it!). Add enough to chill your brew, stirring to speed up the cooling process.</li>
        <li>Finally, add your Oatmilk and watch the coffee and milk combine and swirl together.</li>
        <li>The last step is to enjoy your drink and have a gigantic poo when you've had about half. Dont worry, itll still be cold when you get back.</li>
    </ol>
