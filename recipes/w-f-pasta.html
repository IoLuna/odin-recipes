    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bowtie Pasta</li>
        <li>1 Cup Baby Spinach</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup of Shredded Mozzarella Cheese (Vegan, if you like)</li>
        <li>Marinara Sauce</li>
        <li>A Generous Pinch of Salt</li>
        <li>Freshly Cracked Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>1 Teasppon Onion Powder</li>
        <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium pot, bring 4 cups of cold water to a rolling boil. While filling your pot with water add 2 tablespoons of salt.</li>
        <li>Once boiling, add your pasta and cook for the lower amount of time listed on the box (usually 10 minutes). <em>Tip: Stir for the first 2 minutes of cooking time to keep noodles from sticking to each other and the pot.</em></li>
        <li>Check the done-ness of the pasta ~2 minutes from the timer going off. It should be aldente, or slightly chewy.</li>
        <li>Take a mug or cup and scoop up some of the pasta water, this will be added to the sauce for a boost of flavor.</li>
        <li>Strain the pasta and shake to remove excess water.</li>
        <li>Return the now-empty pot to the stovetop, turn the heat down to medium, and add some oil.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is heated (~1 minute) add your Baby Spinach. This will cook fast, have the marinara sauce ready.</li>
        <li>After the Spinach is wilted, add the sauce and stir.</li>
        <li>Add your noodles back to the pot along with your spices and cheese.</li>
        <li>It is ready when the cheese has melt and the sauce is bubbling and steaming.</li>
        <li>Finally, plate your pasta and garnish with a single, uncooked spinach leaf on top.</li>
        
    </ol>
